Here we go: $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$
Find $(A-B)^2$ and $(A+B)^2$
Solution This is left as an exercise to the reader ;)</description></item><item><title>Circuits II: Lecture 2</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture2/</guid><description>tl;dr The lecture introduced the matrix notation for KCL, i.e. G-Matrices

Topics covered: What is conductance $G$ $[G][V]=[I]$ why does ground not matter (mathematically) doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in a sense that we don&amp;rsquo;t use that node for deriving equations, also that it doens&amp;rsquo;t need to be zero Homework As usual, (isn&amp;rsquo;t it usual if it happend once?) you can find the Homework in both PDF and $\LaTeX$</description></item><item><title>Circuits II: Lecture 1</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture1/</guid><description>tl;dr The lecture introduced the matrix notation for KVL
Basics As we already know from Circuit I, applying KVL&amp;rsquo;s law to a mesh is given by the equation:
$$ \sum{v} = 0 $$
Which can be expanded further, using ohm&amp;rsquo;s law $V=IR$.
$$ \sum{R_S I_S} - \sum{R_m I_m} = \sum{V_s} $$
Where $R_S$ and $I_S$ are the resistance and currents in the mesh, $R_m$ and $I_m$ are the resistance and currents in the mesh that are shared between other meshs, and $v_S$ is is the source voltage (more on polarity later).</description></item><item><title>Engineering Groups</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/eng-groups/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/eng-groups/</guid><description>To add links, please send an email to kfulain.uphrj[at]aleeas.com and expect updates in ~24hrs.

Many engineers were disfigured by the insane amount of math, found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, room sized analog computers, and vacuum-tubed op-amps which burned unceasing in the pooling of madness; some disappeared entirely, or wandered about complexity, sun never touching their skin, breath never warming air.</description></item><item><title>Final Exam: Digital Logic Design - EE232</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</guid><description>This is going to be wild!
Question 1: Part A: Design a combinational circuit that counts the Numbers of 1&amp;rsquo;s in 7-bit ($I_0$ $I_1$, &amp;hellip; $I_6$.) input and has 3-bit output. ($O_0$, $O_1$, $O_3$). And write the input equations.

Stadial, born of the sea-wind through the spruce
Stadial, green-tinged offshoot of my bough, joy and burden of my life
Stadial, fierce and clever, may our clanâ€™s wisdom be yours:
Never Code in C++
But C++ has coded you, word has spread about CS204. You make a mental note to avoid this course, but reassure the course is waiting for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
