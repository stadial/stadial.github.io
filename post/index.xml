Seriously? you don&amp;rsquo;t know about this? :)
Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to. courseoffering has ~137 visits as the time of writing.
I am too lazy to write what is already recorded, here you go.
Success? nah, I have learned that people don&amp;rsquo;t like change.
Future thoughts? I will continue developing the site for my own personal needs, for I don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a schedule manually.</description></item><item><title>Circuits - EE241</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/circuits1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/circuits1/</guid><description>OK, got no time rn, so there is no catchy intro :&amp;rsquo;)
feel free to read this one tho
Stay tuned! (don&amp;rsquo;t stay tuned actually, won&amp;rsquo;t update it)
What does this page have then? Scroll down fren, the final project await you!
ofc i didn&amp;rsquo;t do the project alone, so I don&amp;rsquo;t claim credits for it all!

Here we go: $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$
$$ B = \begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 2 \\ 5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$
Find $(A-B)^2$ and $(A+B)^2$
Solution This is left as an exercise to the reader ;)</description></item><item><title>Digital Logic Design - EE232</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/</guid><description>In the formless days, long before the rise of internet, all spells were woven of pure mistery, all circuits were analog, and death was common. Many engineers were disfigured by the insane amount of math, found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, room sized analog computers, and vacuum-tubed op-amps which burned unceasing in the pooling of madness; some disappeared entirely, or wandered about complexity, sun never touching their skin, breath never warming air.</description></item><item><title>Final Exam: Digital Logic Design - EE232</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</guid><description>This is going to be wild!
Question 1: Part A: Design a combinational circuit that counts the Numbers of 1&amp;rsquo;s in 7-bit ($I_0$ $I_1$, &amp;hellip; $I_6$.) input and has 3-bit output. ($O_0$, $O_1$, $O_3$). And write the input equations.
Show Answer Execuse the messy wiring!

Stadial, born of the sea-wind through the spruce
Stadial, green-tinged offshoot of my bough, joy and burden of my life
Stadial, fierce and clever, may our clanâ€™s wisdom be yours:
Never Code in C++
But C++ has coded you, word has spread about CS204. You make a mental note to avoid this course, but reassure the course is waiting for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
