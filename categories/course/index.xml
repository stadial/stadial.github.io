Many engineers were disfigured by the insane amount of math, found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, room sized analog computers, and vacuum-tubed op-amps which burned unceasing in the pooling of madness; some disappeared entirely, or wandered about complexity, sun never touching their skin, breath never warming air.</description></item><item><title>Engineering Programming - CS204</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/engineering-programing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/engineering-programing/</guid><description>Long ago, on Svalbard, when you were a young witch of forty-three, your mother took your unscarred wrists in her hands, and spoke:

Stadial, green-tinged offshoot of my bough, joy and burden of my life

Never Code in C++
But C++ has coded you, word has spread about CS204. You make a mental note to avoid this course, but reassure the course is waiting for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
