Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to. courseoffering has ~137 visits as the time of writing.

Success? nah, I have learned that people don&amp;rsquo;t like change.
Future thoughts? I will continue developing the site for my own personal needs, for I don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a schedule manually.</description></item></channel></rss>
