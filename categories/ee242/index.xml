Topics covered: What is conductance $G$ $[G][V]=[I]$ why does ground not matter (mathematically) doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in a sense that we don&amp;rsquo;t use that node for deriving equations, also that it doens&amp;rsquo;t need to be zero Homework As usual, (isn&amp;rsquo;t it usual if it happend once?) you can find the Homework in both PDF and $\LaTeX$</description></item><item><title>Circuits II: Lecture 1</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem4/circuits2/lecture1/</guid><description>tl;dr The lecture introduced the matrix notation for KVL
Basics As we already know from Circuit I, applying KVL&amp;rsquo;s law to a mesh is given by the equation:
$$ \sum{v} = 0 $$
Which can be expanded further, using ohm&amp;rsquo;s law $V=IR$.
$$ \sum{R_S I_S} - \sum{R_m I_m} = \sum{V_s} $$
Where $R_S$ and $I_S$ are the resistance and currents in the mesh, $R_m$ and $I_m$ are the resistance and currents in the mesh that are shared between other meshs, and $v_S$ is is the source voltage (more on polarity later).</description></item></channel></rss>
