feel free to read this one tho
Stay tuned! (don&amp;rsquo;t stay tuned actually, won&amp;rsquo;t update it)
What does this page have then? Scroll down fren, the final project await you!
ofc i didn&amp;rsquo;t do the project alone, so I don&amp;rsquo;t claim credits for it all!
Also check disclaimer! DON&amp;rsquo;T USE THIS FOR ACADEMIC DISHONESTY!</description></item><item><title>Digital Logic Design - EE232</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/</guid><description>In the formless days, long before the rise of internet, all spells were woven of pure mistery, all circuits were analog, and death was common. Many engineers were disfigured by the insane amount of math, found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, room sized analog computers, and vacuum-tubed op-amps which burned unceasing in the pooling of madness; some disappeared entirely, or wandered about complexity, sun never touching their skin, breath never warming air.</description></item><item><title>Final Exam: Digital Logic Design - EE232</title><link>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/digital-logic/final-exam/</guid><description>This is going to be wild!
Question 1: Part A: Design a combinational circuit that counts the Numbers of 1&amp;rsquo;s in 7-bit ($I_0$ $I_1$, &amp;hellip; $I_6$.) input and has 3-bit output. ($O_0$, $O_1$, $O_3$). And write the input equations.
Show Answer Execuse the messy wiring!
7bit Adder $$O_0 = I_0 \oplus I_1 \oplus I_2 &amp;hellip; \oplus I_7 $$ $$O_1 = $$ left as an exercise to the reader $$O_3 = $$ left as an exercise to the reader</description></item></channel></rss>
