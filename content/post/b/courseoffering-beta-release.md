# What is this about?
Seriously? you don't know about this? :)

I am too lazy to write what is already recorded, [here you go](https://diode.zone/w/gvhSPdhnE9o1i5c2oDNbAu).

# Success?
nah, I have learned that people don't like change. 

# Future thoughts?

No. I will continue developing the site for my own personal needs, for
I don't want to create a schedule manually.  

I expect others not to use it, and such I won't support anything other
than Engineering Department.
