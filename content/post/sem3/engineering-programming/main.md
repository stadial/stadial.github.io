Long ago, on Svalbard, when you were a young witch of forty-three,
your mother took your unscarred wrists in her hands, and spoke:
> Stadial, born of the sea-wind through the spruce  
> Stadial, green-tinged offshoot of my bough, joy and burden of my life  
> Stadial, fierce and clever, may our clanâ€™s wisdom be yours:  
> 
> Never Code in C++  

But `C++` has coded you, word has spread about CS204. You make a mental note to avoid
this course, but reassure the course is waiting for you.

# AHHHHHHHHH

If you had any doubts whether to get into Computer Science, you will figure out that engineering was the correct choice after taking this course. You are likely to never code again after trying that course too.

# Want... More Details?
Look, to be blunt, the course isn't about coding. It is about... how do
I put that, it is about SYNTAX man. No you won't be making cool l337
programs. You can use `printf` and functions by the end of the course
tho, LOL. I hope you enjoy coding on paper, cuz that what you will be doing!

*And NO this isn't about the Professor/Dr. being bad, he was
really nice, the course itself is trash.*

# TF! who do I pass?

Listen young man, if you got the time do [CS50](cs50.harvard.edu) and
you will likely get that sweet, sweet `A+`. Otherwise, if you are
visting this site during your finals, you have my empathy, scroll down
for a bit and get the links for the final exam questions, and my final
project.

# Last words

This post was a joke ;)  
aaaand the intro was by [Aphyr](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview), modified.  
I should post the project when the grades gets released.
