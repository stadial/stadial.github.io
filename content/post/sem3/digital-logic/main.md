In the formless days, long before the rise of internet, all spells
were woven of pure mistery, all circuits were analog, and death
was common. Many engineers were disfigured by the insane amount of
math, found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, room sized
analog computers, and vacuum-tubed op-amps which burned unceasing in
the pooling of  madness; some disappeared entirely, or wandered about
complexity, sun never touching their skin, breath never warming air.

Digial Logic is a blessing, if only our ancestors knew, many suicides
might not have happened.

# Ignore the rumors
Word has it that `EE232` -Digital Logic Design- is what drives
students insane. This may or may not be true, but we(/I) know that it was
a fun course. It is true that our Professor arrived ~1 month late, and
we speed ran the course, but the course is good. I would say it was a
shame that we skipped `verilog` tho :(

# IDC! Just give me Resources and how to Pass!
Yo calm down, are you by any chance a freshman? If so I think taking
[NAND2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) before hand will improve
the course experience, seeing the complexity of a computer internals
being explained is wonderful.  

Breathe deep, and allow your spirit to come unmoored from 
analog crap, ascending to the plane of digtal world.

# I Got no time! I just want good'ol Exams!
Scroll down fren, you should find quizes, MidTerm and Final Exam!
