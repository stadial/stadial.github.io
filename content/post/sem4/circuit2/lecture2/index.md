# tl;dr
The lecture introduced the matrix notation for KCL, i.e. G-Matrices

# smthn smthn
Read the slides and the book section 3.6

# Topics covered:

- What is conductance $G$
- $[G][V]=[I]$
- why does ground not matter (mathematically)
   doesn't matter in a sense that we don't use that node for deriving
   equations, also that it doens't need to be zero


# Homework
As usual, (isn't it usual if it happend once?) you can find the Homework in both PDF and $\LaTeX$
