# About me

You probably know me as lambda-Î», I am an Electrical Engineering
student at [KFU](https://kfu.edu.sa/), and a self taught Software
Engineer.

I code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Haskell](https://haskell.org/) and
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Use [Artix
Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) and enjoy RegEx!  

In case you are wondering, no this isn't my main blog, this is just
for college related stuff.

# About the site
This site is something I can look back on say "What a journey". Usage
by others is a side effect of that.   
I don't permit anyone to cheat, or use a project of mine. I don't consent
to anyone to use this site for academic dishonesty or any other
illegal act.

# Contact
I am hard to find, on purpose (I don't use social media). You can email
me on `kfulain.uphrj[at]aleeas.com`, and expect replies within 24hrs.
