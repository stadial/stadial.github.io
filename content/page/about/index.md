# About me

You probably know me as lambda-Î», I am an Electrical Engineering
student at [KFU](https://kfu.edu.sa/), and a self taught Software
Engineer.

I live in an ivory tower where I know that I know nothing. I code (but
suck at coding) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Haskell (Still learning!)](https://haskell.org/)
and [Typescript (But forgot!)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Use [Artix
Linux](https://artixlinux.org/) and enjoy [$\LaTeX$](TODO:LINK_LATEX!) (yep,
I loaded an entire js library just for rendering that word)!  

In case you are wondering, no this isn't my main blog, this is just
for college related stuff. Definitely have projects in those languages
but I don't use [this github account](https://github.com/stadial) as
my main.

# About the site
This site is something I can look back on say "What a journey". Usage
by others is a side effect of that.  
I don't permit anyone to cheat, or use a project of mine. I don't consent
anyone to use this site for academic dishonesty or any other illegal
act. Also check [disclaimer](/disclaimer)!

# Contact
I am hard to find, on purpose (I don't use social media). You can email
me on `kfulain.uphrj[at]aleeas.com`, and expect replies within 24hrs.
