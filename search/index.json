You make a mental note to avoid this course, but reassure the course is waiting for you.\nAHHHHHHHHH If you had any doubts whether to get into Computer Science, you will figure out that engineering was the correct choice after taking this course. You are likely to never code again after trying that course too.\nWant\u0026hellip; More Details? Look, to be blunt, the course isn\u0026rsquo;t about coding. It is about\u0026hellip; how do I put that, it is about SYNTAX man. No you won\u0026rsquo;t be making cool l337 programs. You can use printf and functions by the end of the course tho, LOL. I hope you enjoy coding on paper, cuz that what you will be doing!\nAnd NO this isn\u0026rsquo;t about the Professor/Dr. being bad, he was really nice, the course itself is trash.\nTF! who do I pass? Listen young man, if you got the time do CS50 and you will likely get that sweet, sweet A+. Otherwise, if you are visting this site during your finals, you have my empathy, scroll down for a bit and get the links for the final exam questions, and my final project.\nLast words This post was a joke ;)\naaaand the intro was by Aphyr, modified.\nLinks: scroll down\n","date":"2022-01-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://stadial.github.io/p/sem3/engineering-programing/","title":"Engineering Programming - CS204"}]
